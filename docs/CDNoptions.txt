Distributing Your Library via CDN
There are several approaches depending on your needs:

Option 1: Use jsDelivr (Easiest)
If your library is on npm or GitHub, jsDelivr serves it automatically:

html
<!-- From npm -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/your-package@version/dist/file.js"></script>

<!-- From GitHub -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/user/repo@version/file.js"></script>
Steps:

Publish to npm: npm publish
Use the jsDelivr URL immediately (no signup needed)
Option 2: unpkg (npm packages)
html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/your-package@version/dist/file.js"></script>
Just publish to npm and it's available instantly.

Option 3: Self-Hosted with Cloudflare (More Control)
Your Setup:
┌─────────────┐     ┌────────────┐     ┌─────────┐
│ Your Server │ ──► │ Cloudflare │ ──► │  Users  │
│ (origin)    │     │ (CDN/cache)│     │         │
└─────────────┘     └────────────┘     └─────────┘
Steps:

Host files on your server or a subdomain (e.g., cdn.yoursite.com)
Put Cloudflare in front (free tier works)
Set caching rules for your JS/CSS files
Option 4: GitHub Pages (Simple & Free)
Create a repo for your library
Enable GitHub Pages in settings
Access files at: https://username.github.io/repo/dist/file.js
Option 5: Cloud Storage + CDN
Service	Storage	CDN
AWS	S3	CloudFront
Google	Cloud Storage	Cloud CDN
Cloudflare	R2	Built-in
Quick Recommendation
For your own site primarily:

Simplest: GitHub Pages or Cloudflare R2
Best DX:  Publish to npm → use jsDelivr
Example Workflow (npm + jsDelivr)
bash
# 1. Build your library
npm run build

# 2. Publish to npm
npm publish

# 3. Use in your site
html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/my-lib@1.0.0/dist/my-lib.min.js"></script>

To clarify - using github pages will be constrained by rate limits but using github via jsdelivr will not?
🤖
assistant

Yes, that's correct!
GitHub Pages (Direct)
Soft limit: 100GB bandwidth/month
Build limit: 10 builds/hour
GitHub may throttle or disable your site if exceeded
jsDelivr (using GitHub as source)
jsDelivr caches your files on their own CDN infrastructure
After the first request, traffic is served from jsDelivr's edge nodes, not GitHub
No practical rate limits for public repos
Direct GitHub Pages:
User ──► GitHub (limited bandwidth)

Via jsDelivr:
User ──► jsDelivr CDN (cached) ──► GitHub (only on cache miss)
Summary
GitHub Pages	jsDelivr (GitHub source)
Bandwidth limit	~100GB/month	Effectively none
Global edge nodes	Limited	750+ PoPs
Caching	Basic	Aggressive CDN caching
Cost	Free	Free
For a library you're distributing: jsDelivr is the better choice even though both use GitHub as the origin. You get proper CDN benefits without worrying about GitHub's limits.

ok, and what about assets, binaries etc. what my best option for taking those off the site and storing them in CDN?
ideally cost free, but all options considered. I have a smal gallery if textures with thumbnails and a few short mp4 files and some audio. Would be nice to do something simialr with it.
A
CDN Options for Static Assets
Best Free Option: Cloudflare R2
Free Tier
Storage	10 GB
Reads	10 million requests/month
Writes	1 million requests/month
Egress	Unlimited (always free)
This is ideal for your use case. No surprise bills.

Your site ──► R2 bucket (images, mp4, audio)
              └── cdn.yoursite.com
Setup:

Create R2 bucket in Cloudflare dashboard
Enable public access or connect custom domain
Upload assets
Reference via URL in your site
Other Free/Cheap Options
Service	Free Tier	Best For	Catch
Cloudflare R2	10GB, unlimited egress	Everything	None really
Backblaze B2 + Cloudflare	10GB storage	Large files	Slightly more setup
Cloudinary	25 credits/month	Images with transforms	Video limited
Bunny.net	None (but ~$1/month)	Video streaming	Paid only
AWS S3 + CloudFront	5GB (12 months)	Enterprise	Egress costs add up
Backblaze B2 + Cloudflare (Runner-up)
Free egress when paired together (Bandwidth Alliance):

User ──► Cloudflare (free) ──► Backblaze B2 (10GB free)
Good if you need more storage later (very cheap: $0.006/GB).

Quick Comparison for Your Use Case
Small gallery + thumbnails + short videos + audio
≈ Probably under 5GB total?

Winner: Cloudflare R2
- Zero egress fees ever
- Simple setup
- Scales if needed
- Custom domain support
R2 Quick Start
bash
# Install Wrangler CLI
npm install -g wrangler

# Login
wrangler login

# Create bucket
wrangler r2 bucket create my-assets

# Upload file
wrangler r2 object put my-assets/textures/wood.jpg --file=./wood.jpg
Or just use the dashboard UI to drag-and-drop files.

Serving Files
html
<!-- With custom domain configured -->
<img src="https://cdn.yoursite.com/textures/wood-thumb.jpg">
<video src="https://cdn.yoursite.com/videos/demo.mp4"></video>
<audio src="https://cdn.yoursite.com/audio/clip.mp3"></audio>

B
CDN Options for Static Assets (Images, Video, Audio)
Free Tier Options
1. Cloudflare R2 (Best Free Option)
Free tier: 10GB storage, 10 million reads/month
No egress fees (huge advantage)
Built-in CDN automatically
Setup:
1. Create Cloudflare account
2. Create R2 bucket
3. Connect custom domain (e.g., assets.yoursite.com)
4. Upload files
html
<img src="https://assets.yoursite.com/textures/brick.jpg">
<video src="https://assets.yoursite.com/videos/demo.mp4">
2. Backblaze B2 + Cloudflare (Free combo)
B2: 10GB free storage
Bandwidth: Free when paired with Cloudflare (Bandwidth Alliance)
User ──► Cloudflare ──► Backblaze B2
         (cached)       (no egress fee via alliance)
3. GitHub Releases (for binaries)
Attach files to GitHub releases
Serve via jsDelivr:
html
<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/user/repo@tag/assets/texture.jpg">
Caveat: Not ideal for frequently updated assets; better for versioned releases.

Comparison Table
Service	Free Storage	Free Bandwidth	Best For
Cloudflare R2	10GB	Unlimited	Overall best
Backblaze B2 + CF	10GB	Unlimited (via CF)	Budget alternative
GitHub + jsDelivr	Repo size limits	Unlimited	Small/versioned assets
Imgur	Unlimited images	Unlimited	Images only (no video)
Cloudinary	25GB	25GB/month	Image transformations
Paid Options (If You Scale)
Service	Storage	Egress	Notes
AWS S3 + CloudFront	$0.023/GB	$0.085/GB	Enterprise standard
Bunny CDN	$0.01/GB	$0.01/GB	Very cheap
DigitalOcean Spaces	$5/mo 250GB	1TB included	Simple pricing
My Recommendation
For your use case (small gallery, textures, short videos):

Cloudflare R2
├── /textures/
│   ├── brick.jpg
│   ├── brick_thumb.jpg
│   └── ...
├── /videos/
│   └── demo.mp4
└── /audio/
    └── clip.mp3
Why R2:

Free tier likely covers your needs entirely
Zero egress fees even if you exceed free tier
Native CDN (no extra setup)
Custom domain support
S3-compatible API (easy tooling)
Quick Start with R2
bash
# Install Wrangler CLI
npm install -g wrangler

# Login
wrangler login

# Upload files
wrangler r2 object put my-bucket/textures/brick.jpg --file=./brick.jpg
Or just use the Cloudflare dashboard to drag and drop files.
