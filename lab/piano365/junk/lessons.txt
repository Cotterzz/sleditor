So I have a web app that receives midi input, tracks what notes are down, how long they've been pressed and their initial velocity.

It's occurred to me I could turn it into a piano tutor app, by giving instructions and asking the student to repeat them on the keyboard, then monitoring the input and giving the student a score.

If you wanted to give 365 daily lessons, each slightly more complex than the last, assuming the student can't play the piano to begin with (and forgetting theory, just playing)

What typically would be exercise number 1?
What would day 2 look like?
Day 7?
Day 31?
Day 365?

Great concept! Here's a practical progression focusing purely on playing skills:

Day 1: Single Note Recognition
Exercise: "Press Middle C"
Student finds and presses middle C when prompted
App shows visual indicator of correct key
Repeat with 5-10 presses to build muscle memory
Success criteria: Correct key, any velocity/duration
Day 2: Two White Keys
Exercise: Alternate between C and D
Pattern: C-D-C-D (4 times)
Still single finger, but introducing movement
Success criteria: Correct sequence, timing not critical
Day 7: Five-Finger Position
Exercise: C-D-E-F-G played sequentially up and down
Introduction to using all five fingers (C position)
Play: C-D-E-F-G-F-E-D-C
Focus on one finger per key
Success criteria: Correct notes, beginning to monitor evenness
Day 31: Simple Chord Progressions
Exercise: C major triad - E minor - F major - G major
Playing 3-note chords with proper fingering
Whole notes (4 beats each)
Both hands separately, then together
Success criteria: All notes sound together, smooth transitions
Day 365: Intermediate Repertoire Piece
Exercise: Full performance of something like:
Bach Invention No. 8 in F major, or
Chopin Waltz in A minor (B.150), or
First movement of a Mozart Sonatina
Hands together, proper tempo
Dynamic expression (pp to ff)
Success criteria: Correct notes, steady tempo, velocity variations match the score, pedaling if applicable
Each day would build incrementally - adding black keys around day 10, two-hand coordination by day 20, scales by day 40, arpeggios by day 60, and gradually increasing tempo, complexity and expression requirements.

Progressive Piano Curriculum Design
Day 1: Single Key Introduction
Exercise: Press middle C (note 60) four times, evenly spaced.

What you're measuring:

Can they find the right key?
Basic rhythmic consistency (timing between presses)
Pass criteria: Correct pitch, within generous timing tolerance (±300ms)

Day 2: Two Adjacent Keys
Exercise: Alternate between C and D (notes 60, 62), four times each: C-D-C-D-C-D-C-D

What you're adding:

Finger independence (index and middle finger)
Maintaining position while moving
Day 7: Five-Finger Position
Exercise: Play C-D-E-F-G ascending, then G-F-E-D-C descending. Quarter notes at 70 BPM.

What you're adding:

All five fingers of one hand
Following a tempo (your app shows a pulse)
Smoother transitions
By now they've likely covered:

Days 3-4: Adding E, then F, then G individually
Days 5-6: Three and four note sequences
Day 31: Simple Melody + Basic Dynamics
Exercise: Play "Mary Had a Little Lamb" (E-D-C-D-E-E-E, D-D-D, E-G-G, E-D-C-D-E-E-E-E-D-D-E-D-C)

With a twist: First phrase mezzoforte, second phrase piano (soft)

What you're adding:

Velocity control (your app tracks this!)
Musical phrasing
Memorizing longer sequences
By day 31 they've likely covered:

Weeks 2-3: Longer five-finger patterns, simple tunes
Week 4: Introduction to playing softly vs loudly
Day 365: Two-Hand Coordination with Chord Accompaniment
Exercise: Play a simplified arrangement—right hand plays the melody of "Ode to Joy" while left hand plays half-note C and G major triads on the chord changes. Tempo: 90 BPM. With crescendo in the final phrase.

What you're measuring:

Hand independence
Chord accuracy (multiple simultaneous notes)
Sustained timing over a full piece
Dynamic shaping over time
Rough Curriculum Arc
Phase	Days	Focus
1	1-14	Single hand, single notes, building to 5-finger position
2	15-45	Simple melodies, rhythm variety, dynamics
3	46-90	Left hand introduction, very simple two-hand
4	91-180	Hand coordination, basic chords, major keys
5	181-270	Minor keys, arpeggios, more complex rhythms
6	271-365	Full simple pieces, expression, independence
Implementation Thought
Since you're tracking velocity and duration, you could provide nuanced feedback:

"Correct notes! But your D was much louder than the others—aim for consistent volume."
"Good rhythm, but you released the half-notes too early. Hold them for the full beat."
Would you like me to sketch out a more detailed week-by-week breakdown for any particular phase?
